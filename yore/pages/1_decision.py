I have just woke up and had a sudden idea on what I want my first personal
project to be. I want to create my own Legend Tracker for Clash of Clans.
Legend Trackers already exist, but they tend to be inaccurate at times.

To casual players, Legends League is understood to be essentially Clash's
"ranked" mode. It's the most competitive league/division in the game.
One needs to have above 5000 trophies (Clash's elo system) in order to enter.

However, to the top .01% of Legends League players, Legends League is
essentially a business. At times, it can even get quite shady.

Officially, people can make money from playing Clash of Clans in two ways:

1) Official tournaments, such as the World Championships with a prize pool
of one million dollars.

2) Content creation such as Youtube and Twitch.

This is pretty standard for most video games.

However, there is an even shadier side, one tends to be frowned upon
by the developers of the game.

Unofficially, there are three main ways people make money:

1) "Clan Mercenaries:" These are high trophy players that Clan leaders
would pay to join their clan for the month. This is done to boost their Clan
Ranking on the leaderboards and help their clan gain recognition to attract
more players. 


2) Name changes. Players in the top 5-10 of the World leaderboards
are given money to change their name temporarily for the month.

This can be anywhere from 200 to 1000 dollars per account. Remember many of
these guys are playing like 10+ accounts.

3) "Pilotting." High level players are paid to play the accounts of other
players, helping them finish higher in the World rankings at the end of every
month. Funny story, Elon Musk has been exposed for doing this with his
Diablo account.

Because of these lucrative ways to make money unoffically, it has recently
given rise to another lucrative form of business: Subscription services!!!!

Many players want to get better at the game. They want to be able to rise to the
top of the leaderboard and maybe make some money on the side.
