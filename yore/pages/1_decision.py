I have just woke up and had a sudden idea on what I want my first personal
project to be. I want to create my own Legend Tracker for Clash of Clans.
Legend Trackers already exist, but they tend to be inaccurate at times.

For many, Legends League is understood to be essentially Clash's
"ranked" mode. It's the most competitive league/division in the game.
One needs to have above 5000 trophies (trophies are Clash's elo system) in order to enter.

However, to the top .01% of Legends League players, Legends League is
essentially a business. At times, it can even get quite shady.

Officially, people can make money from playing Clash of Clans in two ways:

1) Official tournaments, such as the World Championships with a prize pool
of one million dollars.

2) Content creation such as Youtube and Twitch.

This is pretty standard for most video games.

However, there is an even shadier side, one tends to be frowned upon
by the developers of the game.

Unofficially, there are three main ways people make money:

1) "Clan Mercenaries:" These are high trophy players that Clan leaders
would pay to join their clan for the month. This is done to boost their Clan
Ranking on the leaderboards and help their clan gain recognition to attract
more players. 


2) Name changes. Players in the top 5-10 of the World leaderboards
are given money to change their name temporarily for the month.

This can be anywhere from 200 to 1000 dollars per account. Remember many of
these guys are playing like 10+ accounts.

3) "Pilotting." High level players are paid to play the accounts of other
players, helping them finish higher in the World rankings at the end of every
month. Funny story, Elon Musk has been exposed for hiring a pilot to play Diablo 
IV for him.

As mentioned before, there are many perks to having a high ranking elo in Clash of Clans. Aside 
from the fame and bragging rights, one can even make a substantial amount of money on the
side for playing a video game. This has enticed many casual players to shoot for top ranking
spots on the leaderboards every month.

Seeing this, many pro players see a business opportunity. Many will offer to sell their trade secrets in 
return for x amount of money. 

Clash of Clans can essentially broken down into two core aspects: Offense and Defense. Attack
the bases of other players, while defending your own from attacks. The quickest way to
get better at the game is to improve one's Offense and Defense.

This is where coaching and subscription services come in sold by pro players come in.

For offense, Pro players will offer to coach lower level players on their attacks. These
guys usually charge anywhere from 30-50 bucks an hour.

On defense, for 30 bucks a month, they will share the base layouts that they are using for
the month.

To ensure that the guys who are selling their services are not scammers, Legend Trackers
are critical. These tools allow players to track the offense and defense logs of others,
ensuring that they are not being scammed by some random joe who just bought a high ranking
account and is posing as pro. 

Legend Trackers have the ability to log offense and defensive stats of any player competing 
on the Legends Leaderboard. If a guy claims that he never loses on defense, and attempts 
to sell his bases for 30 bucks a month, all it takes is a quick search of his logs to see 
if he's telling the truth. 

Hence, Legends Trackers are critical assets that ensure that innocent Clash of Clans 
players are not scammed out of their hard earned money. 

Moreover, they provide a lot of data, allowing one to compare their stats to that of 
pro players and get a better understanding of where they stand.
