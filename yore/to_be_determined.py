It's 8:49 pm on a Sunday. At this point in time, I'm not sure what I intend to do with this. Perhaps I'll share it with
recruiters or potential employers. Or maybe I'll just share it with friends and family. Or maybe I won't share it at all.

As of right now, this personal project thingie will serve as a way for me to brush up on my python skills as well as allow me to
refamliarize myself with Github and web development.

My goal will be to constantly update this throughout the semester. Maybe this will serve as a portfolio for my other personal
projects. Or maybe I'll just dump in random, yet phisophical rants? Or, more likely, chances are that this will be the only day
I even work on this thing and it'll end up in the void of forgetten memories. 


Anyways, until next time (hopefully)
